NAME

    Teamspeak - Interface to administrate Teamspeak-Server.


DESCRIPTION

    See the file "Teamspeak.pod" for excruciating detail on all of this.


LIMITATIONS

    * The Web- and Telnet-Connections are not secure.

    * The MySQL-Interface has no functions at the Moment.

    * The tests are not configurable and will fail without a local
      Teamspeak Server.

    following Modules:
      1) Net::Telnet to use the Telnet-Interface.
      2) DBD::mysql to use the MySQL-Interface.
      3) DBD::SQLite to use the SQLite-Interface.
      4) WWW::Mechanize to use the HTTP-Interface.
